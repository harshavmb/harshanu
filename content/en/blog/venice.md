## Introduction

Venice (Venezia in Italian) is a city in the Northern Italy along the Adriatic sea on the East. It is also called as "The Floating City" as it was built on top of lagoons. As Valentine's day was approaching, we wanted to visit a place where we can spend sometime together at a romantic place. Also, Carnival was happening that time which further excited us.

## Travel

We drove from Erding via Salzburg via A8, E55 motorways. Travel time was around 6+ plus hours with little breaks here & there.

## Stay

We stayed at [Crowne Plaza Venice East](https://www.crowneplazavenice.com/en/) for 3 nights. The hotel was adjacent to the railway station "Stazione di Venezia Santa Lucia". Since Venice main island has limited parking space & expensive too, it was kind of perfect for our stay. The hotel was in a serene location & offered complimentary breakfast on all the days we stayed. 

Supermarkets, restaurants are in the vicinity. Hotel also offers a bar in the evening with Pizza & other Italian dishes being offered. 

## Canals in Venice

In total, Venice has 177 canals. One can walk all the day hopping from one bridge to another & getting lost. 
Majority of tourists walk from centre to San Marco (the most happening place in the Venice).

## Gondola

Gondola boats with their elegant, luxurious appearance fascinate many tourists to have an unforgettable romantic experience. Gondola riders will take you through the Canals of Venice, talking about the rich Venezian history.

## Carnival

Every year around February carnival happens in Venice. People wear fantasy costumes with masks hiding their face. We have seen people mostly in the medieval costumes ranging from daemons to angels, priests to athiests & so on.
